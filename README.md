## Data Description
The dataset used in this project was obtained through the New York City open data, and is titled "Motor Vehicle Collissions". This dataset is maintained by the city of New York, and contains daily updated information on collisions and crashes in all five boroughs of New York City. Specific variable names included in the data are things like crash time, exact locational cordinates, vehicle type, and reasons for collisions. It also has data on injuries and deaths from each accident caused.
