## Data Description
The dataset used in this project was obtained from NYC Open Data and is titled Motor Vehicle Collisions. It is maintained by the City of New York and updated daily to reflect every reported crash across all five boroughs. Each entry represents a single motor vehicle collision and includes detailed information such as the date and time of the crash, exact geographic coordinates, vehicle type or make, and contributing factors such as distracted driving or failure to yield. The dataset also records the number of people injured or killed in the incident, which allows us to analyze collision severity and identify patterns related to safety and risk throughout New York City.
